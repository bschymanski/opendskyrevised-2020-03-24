Open DSKY is a Kickstarter project from S&T Geotronics.
It offers a 3D-printed replica of the Display & Keyboard (DSKY) used in the Apollo Command and Lunar Modules.
The design is custom hardware, based on an Arduino Nano. It does not run the original Apollo flight code. Instead, it implements a small subset of functions, such as displaying the time, GPS coordinates, etc., and can play several selected sound bites through an internal speaker.

This project is a fork of rondiamonds openDSKY (https://github.com/rondiamond/OpenDSKY) which is based on S&T's original Arduino code

Refactoring of the original code, to make it more readable and extensible
Possible additional future functionality
Minimal external dependencies
